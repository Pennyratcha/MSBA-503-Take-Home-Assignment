# MSBA503 Object Detection Project

## Overview
This project compares object detection performance using YOLO and Faster R-CNN across a set of images. Additional metrics such as edge count, dominant colors, brightness, and dimensions are also analyzed.

## Features
- **YOLO Object Detection:** Fast detection with fewer objects.
- **Faster R-CNN Object Detection:** Comprehensive but slower detection.
- **Image Analysis:** Extracts edge count, dominant colors, brightness, and dimensions.

## Files
- [Jupyter Notebook: Object Detection]([MSBA 503 Take Home Assignment.ipynb](https://github.com/Pennyratcha/MSBA-503-Take-Home-Assignment/blob/main/MSBA%20503%20Take%20Home%20Assignment.ipynb)): The notebook contains code, outputs, and analysis for object detection and image metrics.
