# MSBA503 Object Detection Project

## Overview
This project compares object detection performance using YOLO and Faster R-CNN across a set of images. Additional metrics such as edge count, dominant colors, brightness, and dimensions are also analyzed.

## Features
- **YOLO Object Detection:** Fast detection with fewer objects.
- **Faster R-CNN Object Detection:** Comprehensive but slower detection.
- **Image Analysis:** Extracts edge count, dominant colors, brightness, and dimensions.

## Files
- [Jupyter Notebook: Object Detection](MSBA 503 Take Home Assignment.ipynb): The notebook contains code, outputs, and analysis for object detection and image metrics.
